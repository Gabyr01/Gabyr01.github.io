## About Me

Hi! I'm Gabriela Rojas, a passionate software engineer on a mission to embrace the ever-evolving world of tech. As a first-generation college student and a proud Latina in tech, I am dedicated to contributing my skills to make a difference through innovative projects and bringing diversity to the industry. With a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering on the horizon (May 2024) I am seeking an entry-level opportunity that allows me to grow, expand my skills, and be part of something extraordinary. I want to be part of a team where innovation is the norm, and each day is an opportunity to learn and contribute.
